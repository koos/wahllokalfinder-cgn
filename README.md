===================
## System Requirements:
- `Ruby 2.3.1`
- `PostgreSQL` Versions 9.1 and up.
## Installation:
After cloning the repository, run:  
- ` $ bundle install `
- ` $ rails db:setup `
- ` $ rails import:stations `
- ` $ rails import:addresses `  

  **NOTE:** Last task may take a while until importing all records to Database.  
  **NOTE:** It may be necessary to add city through  rails-admin (check bellow)
- Setting `ENV[ADMIN_USERNAME]` and `ENV[ADMIN_PASSWORD]` for RailsAdmin.

## Adding Cities:
### FILES
In order to add a new city to WAHLLOKALFINDER, there must be `Stations` and `Addresses` semicolon-separated CSV files, and thosee files must be structured as following:  

- **Addresses:** `zip;street;number_odd_from;number_odd_to;number_even_from;number_even_to;district_name;vote_district_id;landtag_election_district_id;local_election_district_id;bundestag_election_district_id`  

- **Stations:**
`vote_district_id;name;address_street;address_nr;address_nr_note;note;zip;full_address;phone;district;wheelchair_station`  

Both files should be moved to `docs/_CITY_/bundestagswahl-_YEAR_/` in order to get it accessible to `rake importer`.
- `_CITY_` is the name of city. EX: `koeln`
- `_YEAR_` is the bundestagswahl year. EX: `2017`

If the new files are structured as mentioned previously, and it has the correct CSV formats (semicolon-separated entries), then it can be imported to database through the following commands:
- ` $ rails import:stations `
- ` $ rails import:addresses `

Importer will ask for city and year to import.  
It may take a while until it completes.

### ENTRIES
After importing records from CSV files, as described previously, the city must be available from home page:

Go to RailsAdmin => cities => new

- Name: `KÃ¶ln`  
- Slug: `koeln`  
- Zip:
